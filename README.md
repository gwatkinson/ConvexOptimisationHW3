# Convex Optimisation HW3

This is the repo for the HW3 of the Convex Optimisation course of the MVA master.

It contains a theoritical part and a practical one. Both will be in the final notebook.


## Reproducing the results

To reproduce the results presented in the final notebook, you can run the `main_script.py` file:

```
    python main_script.py
```

It also contains the two requested functions:

```python
    from main_script import centering_step, barr_method
```

If you want to go further, you can look at the `test.ipynb` notebook that uses the package developed in `src`. This is the notebook that produced the plots shown in the report.
